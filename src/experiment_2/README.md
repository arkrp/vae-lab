#Experiment 2

This experiment is a proof of concept for a masking encoder using a drop in replacement for NonUniformEncoder from experiment 1. We will:
1. copy the design of experiment 1
2. replace the NonUniformEncoder with a FixedMaskingEncoder
3. train the modified vae on the standard MINST dataset
4. plot the training validation graph
5. display the reconstruction results
6. display the generation results
7. display the imputation results
