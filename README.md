Hannah's vae lab!

Getting started:
    type the command 'source setup.sh' to get your environment set up!

experiment_1 - basic vae experiment has a simple encoder and decoder, trained on MINST.
    Question: Does the VAE model work?
    Result: VAE works as intended. Given sufficient training time it learns to effectively generate and compress the data.
experiment_2 - inpainting VAE based on independence of individual zones of the forward process. Operates on a fixed region that is given and fixed region for inpainting.
    Question: Does the propposed indepenence model produce effective imputation results?
    Result: TBD
